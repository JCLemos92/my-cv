				"As a Frontend Developer on the Workplace team at Natixis, I played a pivotal role in developing internal projects that enhanced operational efficiency. My primary focus was a critical onboarding and offboarding platform, built using Angular with a Spring Boot backend. I was in charge of frontend development, crafting intuitive and responsive user interfaces, while occasionally tackling backend tasks to ensure seamless integration.",
				"After one year, I took on leadership responsibilities as the project main developer, guiding a team of up to four developers. I collaborated closely with product owners to gather requirements, developed comprehensive documentation, designed functional architectures, and managed task allocation through Jira. Additionally, I oversaw support tickets, database management, and user permissions, ensuring the platformâ€™s reliability and security. My ability to balance technical excellence with team coordination drove significant improvements in project delivery and stakeholder satisfaction.",
				"Beyond the main project, I maintained Purple Scan, a secondary web application hosted externally on cPanel. I managed all aspects of this project, from keeping the website updated to handling hosting-related tasks, ensuring its stability and accessibility. As Natixis began transitioning to a Scrum Master role, I briefly took on agile leadership responsibilities before departing, leaving a legacy of impactful solutions and effective team collaboration.",
